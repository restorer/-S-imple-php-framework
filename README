Simple, but powerful php framework.
Includes templates, database abstraction (like .NET SqlClient),
ORM (like RoR ActiveRecord), page class (like .NET) and other classes.
Main idea is to write less code and get more results.

This version is PHP5 only, if you need PHP4 version (why? o_O) you
can find it at sourceforge:

* https://sourceforge.net/projects/zame-simple/
* http://zame-simple.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/zame-simple/tags/latest-for-php4/

At the current moment I think that framework requires refactoring,
but it still nice to use it.

Things to do:

* Use PDO for db layer
* Add model() method in SRecord (like Yii)
* Use array-based configs
* Custom exception classes (instead of using Exception in all cases)
* Remove js_escape in favor of serialize
* Use valid JSON for ajax-based pages (and send it with correct content-type)
